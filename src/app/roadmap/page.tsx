      <p className="mb-6">Building a trading &apos;AI&apos; is a complex process. Here is a high-level roadmap of the steps involved. Each step is a deep topic requiring significant study.</p>

        <div className="p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Part 1: Data Acquisition</h2>
          <p>The first step is to gather vast amounts of historical stock data. This data is the fuel for your AI. You can get it from financial data providers using their APIs. Key data points include open, high, low, close prices, and volume.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Part 2: Feature Engineering</h2>
          <p>Raw data is not enough. You need to create &apos;features&apos; or signals that your AI can learn from. These could be technical indicators like Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), or more complex statistical measures.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Part 3: Model Selection & Training</h2>
          <p>This is where the &apos;AI&apos; comes in. You select a model architecture, such as an LSTM (for time-series) or a Reinforcement Learning model, and train it on your historical data to recognize patterns that predict future price movements.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Part 4: Backtesting</h2>
          <p>Before deploying any strategy, you must test it rigorously on data it has never seen before. This process, called backtesting, helps you evaluate how your AI would have performed in the past. Be wary of overfitting, where the model performs well on past data but fails in the real world.</p>

        <div className="p-6 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Part 5: Paper Trading</h2>
          <p>The final step before risking real capital is to &apos;paper trade&apos;. You connect your AI to a broker&apos;s simulation environment and let it make trades in real-time without using real money. This is a crucial test of its performance in live market conditions.</p>
